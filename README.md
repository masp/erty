# About

Work in progress.

A hobby project to see test out building a BEAM language. The goal is to build a language that is similar to Erlang, but with a few differences:
- Typing is enforced, but not strictly (similar to TypeScript)
- Syntax is more modernized (similar to Go)
- Functional strictness of Erlang is de-emphasized with more emphasis on immutability and pattern matching (e.g. "assignment" is allowed)
